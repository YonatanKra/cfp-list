# CFP List
This project was built for the "Israel Tech CFP Group", to help gather relevant cfp's and make it easy to search and follow the different opportunities.

See it live [CFP List](https://cfplist.herokuapp.com/)

## Feel Free to Change
This project loves contributions, and we've made it as easy to contribute as we could.

Simply run:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/noam-honig/cfp-list
cd cfp-list
npm i 
npm run dev
```

In development, the project uses basic `json` files as a database, when deployed it uses `postgres` database.
